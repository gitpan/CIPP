DESCRIPTION
    This module enables you to use the powerful CIPP HTML embedding
    language together with the Apache webserver. It is based on
    mod_perl and works as a request handler. So you can
    transparently use CIPP pages everywhere on your webserver.

WHAT IS CIPP?
    CIPP is a Perl module for translating CIPP sources to pure Perl
    programs. CIPP defines a HTML embedding language also called
    CIPP which has powerful features for CGI and database
    developers.

    Many standard CGI and database operations (and much more) are
    covered by CIPP, so the developer does not need to code them
    again and again.

    CIPP is not part of this distribution, please download it from
    CPAN.

SIMPLE CIPP EXAMPLE
    To give you some imagination of what you can do with CIPP: here
    is a (really) simple example of using CIPP in a HTML source to
    retrieve some information from a database. Think this as a HTML
    page which is "executed" on the fly by your Apache webserver.
    Note: there is no code to connect to the database. This is done
    implicitely. The configuration is taken from the Apache
    configuration file(s).

      # print table of users who match the given parameter
      
      <?INTERFACE INPUT="$search_name">

      <HTML>
      <HEAD><TITLE>tiny litte CIPP example</TITLE></HEAD>
      <BODY>
      <H1>Users matching '$search_name'</H1>
      <P>

      <TABLE BORDER=1>
      <TR><TD>Name</TD><TD>Adress</TD><TD>Phone</TD></TR>
      <?SQL SQL="select name, adress, phone
                 from   people
                 where  name like '%' || ? || '%'"
            PARAMS="$search_name"
            MY VAR="$n, $a, $p">
        <TR><TD>$n</TD><TD>$a</TD><TD>$p</TD></TR>
      <?/SQL>
      </TABLE>

      </BODY>
      </HTML>

CONFIGURATION
    Place the configuration options listed in the SYNOPSIS into your
    Apache configuration file(s) (e.g. httpd.conf). The SYNOPSIS
    example configures all files with the suffix .cipp to be handled
    by Apache::CIPP. Please refer to the Apache documentation for
    details about configuring your webserver.

    The CIPP PDF documentation contains some more explantation of
    the Apache::CIPP configuration parameters. Also CGI::CIPP
    explains them briefly. You can download the documentation and
    CGI::CIPP from CPAN.

Revision history for Perl extension CIPP.

2.12  Sat Oct 09 1999 joern
	- added a workaround for Informix databases. After connecting
	  to the database, a "set lock mode to wait" is executed,
	  because some Informix databases do not wait on a lock. Instead
	  nothing happens, even no exception is thrown. :(
	  I will add this as an official feature in the near future,
	  called 'initial sql statement' per database. This is more
	  flexible than this hardcoded workaround.

2.11  Thu Sep 30 1999 joern
	- the Changes log has restarted with this version
	- CIPP has now multilanguage support. Error messages
	  are in english or german.
	- the documentation is translated to english. It is not
	  part of this distribution. Please download the package
	  CIPP-Doc from CPAN.


The previous section was in german language only and rather long,
so it is omitted here.

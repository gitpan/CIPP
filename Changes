Revision history for Perl extension CIPP.

2.13	 Mo  Mar  6 2000 joern
	- new release, published to CPAN

2.13_03  Fr  Nov 26 1999 joern
	INTERNAL BETA RELEASE
	
	- Bugfix: debugging output in Apache/CGI Modus crashed

2.13_02	 Fr  Nov 26 1999 joern
	INTERNAL BETA RELEASE
	
	- many CIPP commands were dependent from the context, e.g.
	  it was impossible to use <?GETURL> in a <?PERL> context.
	  Now nearly all CIPP commands can be used in any context,
	  only inside a <?VAR> command context no other CIPP commands
	  can be used (which of course would make no sense ;)
	- new CIPP command <?HTML> to switch from <?PERL> context
	  into HTML context
	- now it is possible to nest <?SQL> commands, if the underlying
	  database engine supports multiple executed statement handles


2.13_01  Thu Nov 25 1999 joern
	INTERNAL BETA RELEASE

	- CIPP debugging source output enhanced: a summary of
	  errors is printed, with hyperlinks to the appropriate
	  sections of the highlighted source code output, so
	  you can navigate through your source code
	- new internal method to get the top level used objects
	  of a CIPP program (the existent methods always flatten
	  the dependency hierarchies)
	- new method for formatting Perl syntax error output, incl.
	  referencing to the corresponding CIPP lines
	- new CIPP command <?MODULE>
	- new CIPP command <?USE>
	- command <?LIB> is deprecated
	- DBI code generator has been slighlty optimized
	- some CIPP global variables of the generated Perl programs
	  did change. Currently there is a compatability patch active,
	  so existant applications (e.g. new.spirit 1.x, Apache::CIPP
	  and friends) must not change. Future releases will depend
	  on the new interfaces. Actually only new.spirit 2.x uses
	  the new style interface.

2.12  Sat Oct 09 1999 joern
	- added a workaround for Informix databases. After connecting
	  to the database, a "set lock mode to wait" is executed,
	  because some Informix databases do not wait on a lock. Instead
	  nothing happens, even no exception is thrown. :(
	  I will add this as an official feature in the near future,
	  called 'initial sql statement' per database. This is more
	  flexible than this hardcoded workaround.

2.11  Thu Sep 30 1999 joern
	- the Changes log has restarted with this version
	- CIPP has now multilanguage support. Error messages
	  are in english or german.
	- the documentation is translated to english. It is not
	  part of this distribution. Please download the package
	  CIPP-Doc from CPAN.


The previous section was in german language only and rather long,
so it is omitted here.

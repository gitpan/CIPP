Revision history for Perl extension CIPP.

2.28	Wed Mar 07 2001 joern
	- updated CIPP::Manual

2.27	Mon Mar 05 2001 joern
	- the BEGIN block at the top of each CGI program is marked
	  with a # sign to tell new.spirit not to strip it off for
	  syntax checking

2.26	Mon Mar 05 2001 joern
	- experimental implementation of Subroutine Includes. Includes
	  are processed to subroutines, instead of copying the content
	  of the include into the actual document. Programs need much less
	  memory and can speed up to 20% in a mod_perl environment.
	  Currently this works only in Apache::CIPP and CGI::CIPP
	  environment. To enable this feature, set $CIPP::INCLUDE_SUBS
	  before CIPP->new(), until this feature is "officiall".
	- a new command: <?DUMP $var ...>. Uses Data::Dumper to dump
	  the listed variables to STDOUT, encapsulated in a <pre> block.
	- added a new option to the SQL commands: DBH. If a DBH option
	  is present, the given variable name is used as the database
	  handle for this operation. It is not possible to use the DBH
	  and DB option in combination.
	  
	  The following SQL related commands recognize the DBH option:
	  
	  <?SQL> <?COMMIT> <?ROLLBACK> <?AUTOCOMMIT> <?DBQUOTE>

2.25	Wed Feb 28 2001 joern
	- fixed html formatting bug in error formatting function

2.24	Sun Feb 25 2001 joern
	- ported dynamic database connection feature to Apache::CIPP
	  and CGI::CIPP. This now works under all CIPP environments.

2.23	Wed Feb 21 2001 joern
	- error formatting in case of a CIPP/new.spirit module name
	  clashing was messed up, but there are still problems in
	  error formatting (very seldom, so I don't hurry ;)

2.22	Mon Feb 19 2001 joern
	Bugfix:
	- <?GETURL> did not work for .png images

2.21	Fri Feb 16 2001 joern
	Bugfix:
	- <?GETPARAM>, <?GETPARAMLIST> and <?SAVEFILE> did not work
	  inside of CIPP modules

2.20	Thu Feb 15 2001 joern
	- <?HTML> forces the preprocessor to generate print statements
	  even in 'cipp/dynamic' mode.

2.19	Thu Feb 15 2001 joern
	- database connections are now establisjed dynamically.
	  In earlier version all required database connections found
	  in the program were established at the top of the program.
	  Now the connection is made on the fly, where needed.

	- WARNING: this code is not tested neither under Apache::CIPP
	           nor CGI::CIPP environment and likely will fail
		   there. Please dont use CIPP 2.19 with these modules.

2.18	Wed Feb 14 2001 joern
	- Bugfix: alternate database names did still not work
	  with new.spirit 2.x

2.17	Mon Feb 12 2001 joern
	- Bugfix: alternate database names did not work with new.spirit 2.x
	- Naming of x.bla.db does now work, project name does not matter

2.16	Tue Feb 11 2001 joern
	- (hopefully) final bug fixing in http header generation:
	  The project wide configured default HTTP header
	  was printed, although 'cipp/dynamic' is set and no
	  <?!HTTPHEADER> occurs.
	- also a HTTP header was printed, if the 'print_content_type'
	  attribute was set to false (e.g. in case of generating
	  a static HTML page with new.spirit)

2.16_01	Tue Feb  6 2001 joern
	- fix for usage with new.spirit 2.x. The new style .m files
	  for object properties broke the object source file resolution
	  algorithm

2.15    Tue Nov 28 2000 joern
	- added <?INPUT TYPE="image" SRC="x.gifs.picture">
	- fixed Bug in HTTP Header generation in case of
	  "cipp/dynamic" mode

2.14_04 Fri Oct 13 2000 joern
	- Bugfix: a broken http header was printed when
	          generating CIPP-HTML files with new.spirit 2.x

2.14_03 Sun Aug 13 2000 joern
	- Include cache works now Ok in Apache::CIPP
	  environments, if same named include occur
	  in different virtual hosts

2.14_02 Tue Aug  8 2000 joern
	INTERNAL BETA RELEASE PRE 2.15
	- this version represents a huge merge of the two CIPP
	  trunks 2-0-9-patches and 2.14_01.

	  2-0-9 implements many mod_perl fixes for using
	  generated CGI programs (new.spirit) under mod_perl.

	  2.14_01 adds many features to the CIPP language
	  and has some internal optimizations.

	- the CIPP/DB_DBI.pm module comes mainly from the
	  2.14_01 trunk. Only some fixes added to the 2-0-9
	  revision in the 2-0-9-patches trunk are added
	  manually to 2.14_01, because 2.14_01 got a major
	  internal redesign of the method interfaces.

	- added STICKY Feature to
		<?INPUT TYPE="checkbox">
		<?INPUT TYPE="radio">

	- added new CIPP Tags
		<?SELECT>
		<?OPTION>
		<?!PROFILE>	(experimental, interface may change)
		<?!HTTPHEADER>
		<?#>

	- Thanks go to Martin H. Sluka <martin@sluka.de> for
	  his suggestion about the STICKY feature.

	- Change syntax of <?GETURL> command. See documentation
	  CIPP::Manual for details
	
	- <?AUTOPRINT> is depreciated. Use <?!AUTOPRINT> instead.

2.14_01  Tue Mar 29 2000 joern
	INTERNAL BETA RELEASE
	- disconnect before connect to prevent rollback
	  ineffective error messages in mod_perl context

2.13	 Mo  Mar  6 2000 joern
	- new release, published to CPAN

2.13_03  Fr  Nov 26 1999 joern
	INTERNAL BETA RELEASE
	
	- Bugfix: debugging output in Apache/CGI Modus crashed

2.13_02	 Fr  Nov 26 1999 joern
	INTERNAL BETA RELEASE
	
	- many CIPP commands were dependent from the context, e.g.
	  it was impossible to use <?GETURL> in a <?PERL> context.
	  Now nearly all CIPP commands can be used in any context,
	  only inside a <?VAR> command context no other CIPP commands
	  can be used (which of course would make no sense ;)
	- new CIPP command <?HTML> to switch from <?PERL> context
	  into HTML context
	- now it is possible to nest <?SQL> commands, if the underlying
	  database engine supports multiple executed statement handles


2.13_01  Thu Nov 25 1999 joern
	INTERNAL BETA RELEASE

	- CIPP debugging source output enhanced: a summary of
	  errors is printed, with hyperlinks to the appropriate
	  sections of the highlighted source code output, so
	  you can navigate through your source code
	- new internal method to get the top level used objects
	  of a CIPP program (the existent methods always flatten
	  the dependency hierarchies)
	- new method for formatting Perl syntax error output, incl.
	  referencing to the corresponding CIPP lines
	- new CIPP command <?MODULE>
	- new CIPP command <?USE>
	- command <?LIB> is depreciated
	- DBI code generator has been slighlty optimized
	- some CIPP global variables of the generated Perl programs
	  did change. Currently there is a compatability patch active,
	  so existent applications (e.g. new.spirit 1.x, Apache::CIPP
	  and friends) need no change. Future releases will depend
	  on the new interfaces. Actually only new.spirit 2.x uses
	  the new style interface.

2.12  Sat Oct 09 1999 joern
	- added a workaround for Informix databases. After connecting
	  to the database, a "set lock mode to wait" is executed,
	  because some Informix databases do not wait on a lock. Instead
	  nothing happens, even no exception is thrown. :(
	  I will add this as an official feature in the near future,
	  called 'initial sql statement' per database. This is more
	  flexible than this hardcoded workaround.

2.11  Thu Sep 30 1999 joern
	- the Changes log has restarted with this version
	- CIPP has now multilanguage support. Error messages
	  are in english or german.
	- the documentation is translated to english. It is not
	  part of this distribution. Please download the package
	  CIPP-Doc from CPAN.


The previous section was in german language only and rather long,
so it is omitted here.
